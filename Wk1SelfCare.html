        <p>My sanity saver this year was my spin bike. I am far too cheap to buy a Peloton and then wait 8 weeks for it to arrive. For 1/2 the price of one Peloton bike, we purchased two Sunny Evolution Pro II bikes. 
            Same magnetic resistance and sturdy feel, but it arrived within a week and allowed my husband and I to workout together. 
        </p>
        <p> We tried the Peloton app by streaming it through our Amazon Firestick and were underwhelmed. The Les Mills On Demand app offered more engaging classes like:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The Trip</li>
            <li>Sprint</li>
            <li>RPM</li>
            <li>and many classes that do not require a spin bike like Body Pump</li>
            
        </ul>
